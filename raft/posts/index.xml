      <description>22 is a weird age. My life is self directed again, this time with a million options.
It is as important as eighteen. Three years ago I left school to do a &amp;ldquo;degree apprenticeship&amp;rdquo;, working four days and studying for one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to start a corporate job so soon but it felt and was right. I&amp;rsquo;ve now graduated, still working at a consultancy, but it&amp;rsquo;s time to think what&amp;rsquo;s next as my contract&amp;rsquo;s renewal is coming and what&amp;rsquo;s next and best for me.</description>

      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m asiimov, 21 and living in the United Kingdom. My parents migrated from Pakistan and Hong Kong to England where I was shortly born. I have always been curious on how everything works but computers are what fascinated me.
Many years later I picked up computer science at GCSE (UK&amp;rsquo;s equivalent GED) and I loved it, my teacher was amazing and always went the extra mile. My friend spotted a poster for a &amp;lsquo;hacking competition&amp;rsquo; and that&amp;rsquo;s where I started.</description>
