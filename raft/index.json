[{"content":"22 is a weird age. My life is self directed again, this time with a million options.\nIt is as important as eighteen. Three years ago I left school to do a \u0026ldquo;degree apprenticeship\u0026rdquo;, working four days and studying for one. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to start a corporate job so soon but it felt and was right. I\u0026rsquo;ve now graduated, still working at a consultancy, but it\u0026rsquo;s time to think what\u0026rsquo;s next as my contract\u0026rsquo;s renewal is coming and what\u0026rsquo;s next and best for me.\nTwenty-one was different. Between 18 and 20, I felt like I was stagnant. Not really doing much, definitely not doing enough. It feels like a blur, I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it I still accomplished my goals and it was my more sociable years but I could\u0026rsquo;ve always done better, done more. But 21 was when things started to change. Finally started working on myself and my skills - though 21 is just the start. I still have a long list of what I want to learn but the main change has been focus, instead of learning ten at once it\u0026rsquo;s one.\nThis past year\u0026rsquo;s been full of new stuff. Made a twitter account (thank you @jxnlco) and had more insight of different lines of work that I didn\u0026rsquo;t consider such as consulting/contracting etc.\nStarted doing things I should\u0026rsquo;ve done before. Started to look after my health after I went to a physiotherapist and she said my wrist mobility is awful, despite the pains, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to be able to improve them before losing my hands it all makes a massive impact on the quality of life.\nNone of these things are that impressive on their own. But looking back at where I was and where I am now - it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly where I want to be yet, but at least I\u0026rsquo;m heading somewhere. That\u0026rsquo;s more than I could say a year ago.\nnew year, new paths I want to explore more, do more, output more.

My parents migrated from Pakistan and Hong Kong to England where I was shortly born. I have always been curious on how everything works but computers are what fascinated me.\nMany years later I picked up computer science at GCSE (UK\u0026rsquo;s equivalent GED) and I loved it, my teacher was amazing and always went the extra mile. My friend spotted a poster for a \u0026lsquo;hacking competition\u0026rsquo; and that\u0026rsquo;s where I started.\nI learned a lot of skills, both defensive and offensive and as a result I was able to place top 500 out of 70,000 participants for two years. I was then fortunate to join a CTF team for Cyber Centurion, a competition for hardening and securing three Operating Systems within three hours, where my team positioned first out of roughly 200 teams.\nAfter I was able to get my results to go university but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for me. I had an offer for a degree apprenticeship that allowed me to get a paid degree, salary and experience. It is honestly the best decision, I have met so many bright minds, been able travel, and learn from colleagues with significant experience. Currently I aim to complete my project and aim towards the OSCP certification.\nCurrently I am currently exploring AI/ML and how we can best protect them from both an offensive and defensive perspective.\nFeel free to reach out on x\n","permalink":"https://asii.mov/posts/intro/","summary":"Hi I\u0026rsquo;m asiimov, 21 and living in the United Kingdom.
