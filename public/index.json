It\u0026rsquo;s always nice to share thoughts, vibes and whatever so this is my playground.\nDuring my school years one the subject that I neglected was English, having many substitute teachers with no care and lack of interest I neglected it. I realised that it\u0026rsquo;s essential to articulate yourself well, it\u0026rsquo;s how you present yourself, impressions and more. I thought to start now, a blog is a good way of me writing and seeing how I improve over time.\nwhoami Hi I\u0026rsquo;m asiimov, 21 and living in the United Kingdom. My parents migrated from Hong Kong to England where I was shortly born. I always found it cool to learn how things worked but computers are what got me. Many years later I picked up computer science at GCSE (UK\u0026rsquo;s equivalent GED) and I loved it, my teacher was amazing and always went the extra mile. My friend spotted a poster for a \u0026lsquo;hacking competition\u0026rsquo; and that\u0026rsquo;s where it started. I learned a lot of skills both defensive and offensive and I was able to place top 500 out of 70,000 participants for two years. I was then fortunate to join a CTF team for Cyber Centurion, a competition for hardening and securing three Operating Systems within three hours, where my team came first out of roughly 200 teams.\nFrom there I was able to get my results to go university but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for me. I had an offer for a degree apprenticeship that allowed me to get a paid degree, salary and experience. It is honestly the best decision, I have met so many bright minds, travel, and learn from colleagues who have been working twenty to fourty years. Currently I aim to complete my dissertation and aim towards the OSCP certification.\nI am currently exploring AI/ML and web development.\nFeel free to reach out on twiter or discord\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/intro/","summary":"the why Being from a rather small city there\u0026rsquo;s not many people aligned with tech and the only exposure I have is my workplace.
