I was speaking to my friends who went through the traditional route of school, university and are now looking for a job.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied and attended conferences, events, and so forth. But when I asked \u0026ldquo;how many did you apply for\u0026rdquo; they all collectively applied for zero and attended zero, the opportunity cost of nothing.\nWhy didn\u0026rsquo;t they apply? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not smart enough\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo;, the list goes on but it\u0026rsquo;s simple. You make your own luck.\nBecome lucky Luck is a chance of a good outcome but people fail to realise you have more control on your luck than you think. The odds can stay the same but the more you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you prepare to fail, you will. Most people won\u0026rsquo;t try, will try once or won\u0026rsquo;t put much effort or thought into it.\nA study by Wiseman found that lucky people were \u0026ldquo;skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition, create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.\u0026rdquo;\nIf every application has a 1 in 10 chance, iteratively apply 100 times. If you get rejected, reach out for feedback and look what\u0026rsquo;s missing. Ultimately the goal is to be better than the next person, what can you do to be better? People fear rejection instead of embracing it, if you fail a test you look to see where you went wrong and that applies to most things.\nEmbrace rejection and fear The first event I attended was because I won a capture the flag, I was the top 500 out of 50,000 in a field where I had no prior work. This was my second attempt, I worked relentlessly to win the first year but I missed it by a small margin. I wanted to do better so I did, I kept the same focus, same goals. The second year I did it and the third year again. This lead to me working on other events and meeting some incredibly talented people.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s since that moment I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to embrace rejection and soon fear. I was fairly introverted, I\u0026rsquo;ve known most of my friends since I was 11 years old. This changed on a client trip, the rain was heavy meaning the trains were delayed. I sat next to someone and we didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything until I offered them some biscuits. From the biscuits we talked about the trains, work and values. It was my conversation starter until I grew more and more, I can speak to strangers. But what if I didn\u0026rsquo;t, what was the cost? I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have met managers from Deloitte, senior security staff at MasterCard, some international students from China, and a stranger I met hundreds of miles away from home yet they lived five minutes from my home. I started small but now I\u0026rsquo;m able to strike up a conversation with anyone.\nThe opportunity cost of nothing is exactly as it says, nothing. If you don\u0026rsquo;t ask you don\u0026rsquo;t get, if you don\u0026rsquo;t try you don\u0026rsquo;t know. Is the five minutes of rejection enough to keep you on the same path or will you try again?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/opportunity-cost/","summary":"You are applying for an opportunity.

My life is self directed again, this time with a million options.\nIt is as important as eighteen. Three years ago I left school to do a \u0026ldquo;degree apprenticeship\u0026rdquo;, working four days and studying for one. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to start a corporate job so soon but it felt and was right. I\u0026rsquo;ve now graduated, still working at a consultancy, but it\u0026rsquo;s time to think what\u0026rsquo;s next as my contract\u0026rsquo;s renewal is coming and what\u0026rsquo;s next and best for me.\nTwenty-one was different. Between 18 and 20, I felt like I was stagnant. Not really doing much, definitely not doing enough. It feels like a blur, I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it I still accomplished my goals and it was my more sociable years but I could\u0026rsquo;ve always done better, done more. But 21 was when things started to change. Finally started working on myself and my skills - though 21 is just the start. I still have a long list of what I want to learn but the main change has been focus, instead of learning ten at once it\u0026rsquo;s one.\nThis past year\u0026rsquo;s been full of new stuff. Made a twitter account (thank you @jxnlco) and had more insight of different lines of work that I didn\u0026rsquo;t consider such as consulting/contracting etc.\nStarted doing things I should\u0026rsquo;ve done before. Started to look after my health after I went to a physiotherapist and she said my wrist mobility is awful, despite the pains, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to be able to improve them before losing my hands it all makes a massive impact on the quality of life.\nNone of these things are that impressive on their own. But looking back at where I was and where I am now - it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly where I want to be yet, but at least I\u0026rsquo;m heading somewhere. That\u0026rsquo;s more than I could say a year ago.\nnew year, new paths I want to explore more, do more, output more.
