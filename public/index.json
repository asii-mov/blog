[{"content":"Hi I\u0026rsquo;m asiimov, 21 and living in the United Kingdom. My parents migrated from Pakistan and Hong Kong to England where I was shortly born. I have always been curious on how everything works but computers are what fascinated me.\nMany years later I picked up computer science at GCSE (UK\u0026rsquo;s equivalent GED) and I loved it, my teacher was amazing and always went the extra mile. My friend spotted a poster for a \u0026lsquo;hacking competition\u0026rsquo; and that\u0026rsquo;s where I started.\nI learned a lot of skills, both defensive and offensive and as a result I was able to place top 500 out of 70,000 participants for two years. I was then fortunate to join a CTF team for Cyber Centurion, a competition for hardening and securing three Operating Systems within three hours, where my team positioned first out of roughly 200 teams.\nAfter I was able to get my results to go university but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for me. I had an offer for a degree apprenticeship that allowed me to get a paid degree, salary and experience. It is honestly the best decision, I have met so many bright minds, been able travel, and learn from colleagues with significant experience. Currently I aim to complete my project and aim towards the OSCP certification.\nCurrently I am currently exploring AI/ML and how we can best protect them from both an offensive and defensive perspective.\nwhy I blog Being from a rather small city there\u0026rsquo;s not many people aligned with tech and the only exposure I have is my workplace. It\u0026rsquo;s always nice to share thoughts, improve my writing and more.\nFeel free to reach out on x or email samee@asii.mov\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/intro/","summary":"Hi I\u0026rsquo;m asiimov, 21 and living in the United Kingdom.
