Hi I'm asiimov, 21 and living in the United Kingdom. My parents migrated from Pakistan and Hong Kong to England where I was shortly born. 
I have always been curious on how everything works but computers are what fascinated me. 

Many years later I picked up computer science at GCSE (UK's equivalent GED) and I loved it, my teacher was amazing and always went the extra mile. My friend spotted a poster for a 'hacking competition' and that's where I started. 

I learned a lot of skills, both defensive and offensive and as a result I was able to place top 500 out of 70,000 participants for two years. I was then fortunate to join a CTF team for Cyber Centurion, a competition for hardening and securing three Operating Systems within three hours, where my team positioned first out of roughly 200 teams. 

After I was able to get my results to go university but it wasn't for me. I had an offer for a degree apprenticeship that allowed me to get a paid degree, salary and experience. It is honestly the best decision, I have met so many bright minds, been able travel, and learn from colleagues with significant experience. Currently I aim to complete my project and aim towards the OSCP certification.

Currently I am currently exploring AI/ML and how we can best protect them from both an offensive and defensive perspective.
