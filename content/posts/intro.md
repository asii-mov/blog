# whoami
Hi I'm asiimov, 21 and living in the United Kingdom. My parents migrated from Hong Kong to England where I was shortly born. I always found it cool to learn how things worked but computers are what hooked me. Many years later I picked up computer science at GCSE (UK's equivalent GED) and I loved it, my teacher was amazing and always went the extra mile. My friend spotted a poster for a 'hacking competition' and that's where it started. I learned a lot of skills both defensive and offensive and I was able to place top 500 out of 70,000 participants for two years. I was then fortunate to join a CTF team for Cyber Centurion, a competition for hardening and securing three Operating Systems within three hours, where my team positioned first out of roughly 200 teams. 

After I was able to get my results to go university but it wasn't for me. I had an offer for a degree apprenticeship that allowed me to get a paid degree, salary and experience. It is honestly the best decision, I have met so many bright minds, been able travel, and learn from colleagues who have been working between twenty to  thirty years. Currently I aim to complete my dissertation and aim towards the OSCP certification.

I am currently exploring AI/ML and web development.

# the why
Being from a rather small city there's not many people aligned with tech and the only exposure I have is my workplace. It's always nice to share thoughts, vibes and whatever so this is one way.

Another reason is that during my school years one the subject that I neglected was English, having many substitute teachers with no care and lack of interest I neglected it. I realised that it's essential to articulate yourself well, it's how you present yourself, impressions and more. I thought to start now, a blog is a good way of me writing and seeing how I improve over time.
