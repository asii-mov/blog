    Title: Who is asiimov?
    Content: I'm a 21-year-old Security Consultant working at a Fortune 500 consultancy whilst pursuing my undergraduate degree at Northeastern University. I found my passion in cybersecurity through government programs and winning events such as Cyber Discovery Elite and Cyber Centurion. At 18 I begun my career, working in DevSecOps and transitioned to Security Consulting in January 2024. I started this blog to improve my writing and to meet new people :)
